Description: build software in a disposable virtual machine
 vectis compiles software and does other Debian-related tasks in a temporary
 environment, using an implementation of the autopkgtest virtualisation
 service interface.
 .
 To minimize side-effects on the host system by the built code, and
 side-effects on the built code by the host system, vectis does all builds
 in a newly cloned virtual machine (or in theory a container, but that mode
 has not yet been tested).
 .
 To avoid the need to back up large VM or container images, vectis can
 rebuild its own VM images and sbuild tarballs at any time.
 .
 To increase confidence that a package that builds successfully in vectis
 will also build successfully in real Debian infrastructure, vectis tries
 to be pedantically correct: builds use a sbuild configuration closely
 resembling the real buildds, and in particular Architecture:any and
 Architecture:all binary packages are built separately by default,
